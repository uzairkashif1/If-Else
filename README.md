## 🧾 README — If and Else in Python

### 📘 Introduction

In Python, the **if** and **else** statements are used to make decisions in a program.
They help the program choose different actions depending on whether a condition is **true** or **false**.

---

### 💡 Purpose

* The `if` statement checks a **condition**.
* The `else` statement runs when the `if` condition is **not true**.
* These statements make your code **smarter and dynamic**.

---

### 🧠 How It Works

1. Python reads the `if` condition.
2. If the condition is **true**, the code inside `if` runs.
3. If the condition is **false**, the code inside `else` runs.

---

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

* Using `=` instead of `==` for comparison.
* Forgetting to add a colon `:` after `if` or `else`.
* Writing code without proper indentation (spaces or tabs).

---

### 📝 Notes

* Python is **case-sensitive**, so `True` and `true` are different.
* You can use `elif` to check multiple conditions.
* Always keep your code clean and readable.

---

### ✅ Summary

`if` and `else` are simple but powerful tools for decision making in Python.
They control how your program behaves depending on user input or data conditions.
